If you\'re like most of us you have a lot of photos and videos on your computer that aren\'t backed up anywhere. You\'ve probably thought about doing it but haven\'t done it yet because a professional backup will cost too much money and you\'re not sure how to do it yourself.

And keeping all your photos and videos in "the cloud" isn\'t always safe either. You have to pay storage fees every month and someone could always hack in and either delete or expose all your private memories.

Doing a manual backup to the Cloud isn\'t easy either. It can take 5-6 hours to go through each folder manually and upload your photos and videos one at a time. It\'s a nightmare!

The worst part is - you have to repeat that 5-6 hour process every week or month or you\'ll probably forget or give up after a while and go back to not backing up at all.

Luckily, a brand new innovative little device can solve all of these problems for you. With it, you can backup and protect all of your photos, videos and memories in one click of a button. You click one button and it will do the rest for you!

What is it?
It\'s called the PhotoStick. A tiny little USB drive that uses the latest innovative technology to go through you computer, grab all of your photos, videos and memories and save them to USB in one click. It works well with both Mac and Windows computers, so everyone can use it.

But a bit of rain on Saturday kept him from one of the solemn gatherings ― and his no-show prompted a chorus of scorn.

Trump skipped a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, with a White House statement citing “scheduling and logistical difficulties caused by the weather” for the decision.

The cemetery is the final resting place of many of the 1,800 American soldiers killed in the battle of Belleau Wood.

In his place, Trump sent a delegation led by White House chief of staff John Kelly, who traveled in a small motorcade to the cemetery that is about an hour’s drive from Paris. 

Trump’s absence earned him harsh criticism from a range of current and former U.S. and European officials over social media.

David Frum, a one-time speechwriter for President George W. Bush, voiced astonishment in a series of tweets, writing, “It’s incredible that a president would travel to France for this significant anniversary ― and then remain in his hotel room watching TV rather than pay in person his respects to the Americans who gave their lives in France for the victory gained 100 years ago tomorrow.”

It remains unclear how the weather impeded the president’s plans.

A helicopter ride aboard Marine One may have been too risky. Been the weather did not deter French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday from making a trip by car to a town in northern France where the Allies and Germany signed the Armistice ending the war, the BBC noted. Macron and Merkel unveiled a commemorative plaque at the event.

British Parliament member Nicholas Soames ― a grandson of Winston Churchill ― reacted to Trump’s absence at the cemetery event by calling the U.S. president “pathetic.”

Soldiers “died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate [Trump] couldn’t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen,” Soames wrote on Twitter. ',

<p>That isn\'t clear. Butte County Sheriff\'s Investigations Sgt. Steve Collins told CNN that authorities are working from a list of people whose loved ones have called in welfare checks for them or have reported them missing. From there, he says, officers go out to confirm if their structure is still standing or if the loved one who called in has heard from them.

Rescue workers sift through rubble in search of human remains at a burned property in Paradise, California on November 14, 2018.
The process is made even more difficult, Butte County Sheriff and Coroner Kory Honea said, by difficulty communicating with the displaced.
"There are a lot of people displaced and we\'re finding a lot of people don\'t know we are looking for them," Honea said. If people find their own or loved ones\' names on the list at the Butte County Sheriff\'s ffice\'s website, they should call the sheriff\'s office, Honea said.</p>
<p>Are the people unaccounted for mostly seniors?
The list of the missing includes people of all ages. But it also has a lot of seniors, with one as old as 101.
At least 73 of the 103 people listed as missing in the Butte County city Paradise are over the age of 65, according to CNN affiliate KSTU.
Do officials have a final death toll?</p>
<p>The number of fatalities from the fires has gone up almost daily as officials continue to search.
Many factors make it difficult for officials to reach a final death toll. One, according to Collins, is simply that there is still so much left to search.
"It\'s not just the area," said Collins. "It\'s the number of homes, the number of trailers, the multi-story buildings. All of that changes the complexity of this operation."
Then, he said, anthropologists must identify remains as human.</p>
<p>Search and rescue workers search for human remains at a trailer park burned out from the Camp Fire.
And once authorities know they have found human remains, they reach another obstacle in identifying the victims.
Honea has invited relatives of the missing to visit the sheriff\'s office in Oroville, California so authorities can collect DNA samples from them. The DNA will be used to help identify fire victims, Honea said</p>.',

<p>The sketch featured Kate McKinnon as Ingraham teasing an upcoming segment about how "celebrities in California are whining about some tiny wildfires, while our heroic president is under constant attack — from rain."</p>

<p>Cecily Strong played firebrand Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro warning about what McKinnon’s Ingraham called "rampant voter fraud that allowed Democrats to literally steal the election."</p>

<p>"Some have claimed that suburban women revolted against the Republican Party — but doesn’t it feel more true that all Hispanics voted twice?" McKinnon’s Ingraham said. "You can’t dismiss that idea simply because it isn’t true and sounds insane."</p>


<p>More "feel facts" designed to pander to the stereotypical Fox News crowd followed, like "Santa is Jesus\'s dad," "blackface is a compliment" and "If the Earth is so warm, then why are my feet cold?"</p>

<p>Strong’s Pirro offered up examples that included one person being able to impersonate many — holding up Eddie Murphy’s "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" — and a "huge increase in what people call stacking, where multiple children will stack on top of each other, under a trench coat and then vote as an adult."</p>

<p>The sketch also lampooned parody advertisers on the faux-Fox show, including a fashion catheter company, the manufacturer of baptism kits for dogs and a brand of "whites only" eggs — "it\'s just egg whites, and it’s just for us." (A parody of a derided real-life "vape god" segment also made an appearance.)</p>

<p>"SNL" was hosted by Steve Carell, the boss from the hit show "The Office," who returned to host for the third time.</p>
